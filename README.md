# miniExplorer
Function that launches a form that resembles Windows Explorer.  The reason this was built is due to MTA PowerShell GUI scripts, and issues with FolderBrowserDialog.

# Example
If you have a PowerShell script that requires a user to select a .csv file, you can run: <br /><br /> ---> Start-miniExplorer -ShowFilesWithExtensionOnly csv <---<br /><br /> This will only show .csv files within miniExplorer, in the current folder structure.
